Inparticular, from a sdef file one can obtain a Rez file (with .r extension)describing an 'aete' resource or a pair of terminology files for Cocoascripting (<I>.scriptSuite</I> and <I>.scriptTerminology</I> files).<P><B>Aete2sdef</B> does the opposite: starting from an <B>'aete'</B> (<I>AppleEvent Terminology Extension</I>) or an <B>'aeut'</B> (<I>AppleEventUser Terminology</I>) resource, it generates a sdef file.<P>What is this useful for? Well, sdef files are recent while the 'aete'resources have been used by developers for years. If someone wants toswitch to the sdef scheme, rewriting everything from scratch can bepainful: with <B>Aete2sdef</B> you can retrieve all your 'aete' data andget a good basis for starting working in the new environment. It can alsohelp you to transfer your 'aete' resources to Cocoa scripting, if you arerewriting an application from Carbon to Cocoa for instance: you would apply<B>Aete2sdef</B> to the 'aete' resource to get a sdef file, and then applythe <I>sdp</I> tool to this sdef file to get <I>.scriptSuite</I> and <I>.scriptTerminology</I> files.<P>There is not a one-to-one mapping between the data contained in an 'aete'resource and in a sdef file. The conversion in both directions isnecessarily lossy. Nevertheless <B>Aete2sdef</B> does its best to preservewhat they have in common.<P>Aete2sdef is <B>scriptable</B> (see below).<P><A NAME="howto"></A><H2><A NAME="M2"></A>How does it work</H2><P><B>Aete2sdef</B> operates on files which contain 'aete' or 'aeut'resources (typically application files). It extracts the resources andproduces an sdef file for each of them. If your original file is <I>MyApp.rsrc</I> and it contains two 'aete' resources with ID 128 and 129respectively, <B>Aete2sdef</B> will create two files named <I>MyApp_aete128.sdef</I> and <I>MyApp_aete129.sdef</I> respectively in thesame folder as the input file.<P>The output files are <B>UTF-8 encoded</B> as stated in their top processing instruction:<P>    <I>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</I><P> If you want the sdef files to be in another encoding, you will have to convert them using an appropriate text editor.<P>There are three different ways of making this conversion: <OL> 	<LI> when it is running, the <B>Aete2sdef</B> application has a singlemenu item called <I>Convert Aete...</I> which lets you select the filecontaining 'aete' or 'aeut' resources you want to convert.<P>	<LI> in the <B>Finder</B>, you can also just drag the file cntaining the'aete' or 'aeut' resources and drop it on the icon of <B>Aete2sdef</B>.One can drag and drop several files simultaneously onto the icon of theapplication.<P>	<LI> you can execute these actions in an <B>AppleScript</B> script. For instance, you can execute the following instruction in the <I>AppleScript Editor</I>:<PRE>	tell application "Aete2sdef"		set theFile to (choose file)		convert theFile	end tell</PRE></OL><P>Note that <B>Aete2sdef</B> expects a file as input: it will not accept abundle. If your resource file is inside a bundled application, you mustspecify the complete path to the resource file, like<I>/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/MyApp.rsrc</I><P><A NAME="download"></A><H2><A NAME="M3"></A>Download</H2>To download the application <A HREF="http://perso.orange.fr/bdesgraupes/Downloads/Aete2sdef.hqx">click here.</A><P><I>Aete2sdef</I> is a free software.Its <A HREF="http://perso.orange.fr/bdesgraupes/Downloads/Aete2sdefSrc.hqx"> source code</A>is also publicly available.<P><H2><A NAME="M4"></A>Version History</H2><UL>	<LI> 2005-02-22 - 1.0 - First public release.	<LI> 2006-10-18 - 1.1 - Correctly escapes standard XML entities.
